design-in-browser
=================

Framework for rendering static sample websites, allowing designers to quickly itterate using the modern tools of the web

Install Requirements
===================

Runs on python 3.4 for now, but it likely backwards compatible.

Will require compass eventually, so:

```
apt-get install ruby-dev
gem install compass
```

Verified for compass version 0.12.7
